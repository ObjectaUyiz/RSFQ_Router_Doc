====================


**Log**:
    1. Draw a diagram for level by level routing and how the final output should look like

        .. image:: /media/output.png
            :alt: output diagram
            :align: center

    2. diagram representation for algorithm

        2.1. find 2 continuous level of cells, according to simple architecture, we first find the widthest cell for both levels, then width1+ width2 + routing width is the width of the level grids:

            .. image:: /media/initialRoutingLevel.png
                :alt: initialRoutingLevel
                :align: center

        2.2. For each level, we combine them into 1 piece, as shown in output diagram.

    3. researching more path finding algorithm and try to replace the gbfs routing to improve the performance.
